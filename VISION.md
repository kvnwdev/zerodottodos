# 0.todos

## essence

0.todos is built on a simple truth: you have enough time to make things happen.

most task managers add to your cognitive load rather than reduce it. 0T takes the opposite path - an intentionally minimal approach that gets out of your way.

## inspiration

saw a simple post on x. it was this like list of months marked out. pictured below.

## principles

1. **visual simplicity** - dots represent days. filled dots show completion. empty dots await your progress.
2. **zero friction** - zero menus. no complexity. log in and track progress.
3. **three states** - everything fits into three categories:
   - **soon** - things to do eventually
   - **now** - active and prioritized
   - **hold** - awaiting external events
4. **visible progress** - see your journey at a glance through dots, revealing patterns of execution over time.

## intentional limitations

we deliberately avoid:

- due dates that create artificial pressure
- priority systems requiring maintenance
- complex organization
- feature expansion of any kind

## for whom

i made it for myself, but it's designed for anyone who:

- tracks completion rather than complex projects
- feel overwhelmed by traditional task managers
- appreciate visual representations of progress
- value simplicity in their tools

## evolution

in order for this app to evolve, it must aim to:

1. preserve the minimal experience'
2. reduce rather than increase cognitive load
3. enhance clarity of progress

0.todos is a journal of accomplishment. it's not a demanding taskmanager.
